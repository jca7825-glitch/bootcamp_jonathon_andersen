# Data Cleaning
## Strategy

The cleaning strategy uses the same functions as in class. I've taken the score, age, and income where we've then taken the median of the data and replaced the empty cell with its median. Similarly, any cells that had empty cells after the median, like the city were simply dropped because there is no median for a location. 

All data is housed in /data

for the cleaned: data/processed/.csv
for the raw: data/raw/.csv
