# Project Title
**Stage:**
The problem posed in class is that our project manager has asked whether the current ETF strategy will remain effective going into the next year. Without knowing the exact method currently in use, we need to assess potential shortcomings and unforeseen risks of maintaining a status quo approach. 
## Problem Statement
<1–2 paragraphs: what problem & why it matters>

The way an ETF is managed directly impacts its earnings performance. If an ETF underperforms relative to the market, it loses market value, which can lead to financial losses for the company. As a result, selecting the right management strategy can mean the difference between growth and decline.

Our focus will be to determine which market factors and data are essential for evaluating the strategy’s viability, and to identify the variables most likely to skew results in a negative direction.
