# Project Title
**Stage:**
The problem posed in class is that our project manager has asked whether the current ETF strategy will remain effective going into the next year. Without knowing the exact method currently in use, we need to assess potential shortcomings and unforeseen risks of maintaining a status quo approach. 
## Problem Statement
The way an ETF is managed directly impacts its earnings performance. If an ETF underperforms relative to the market, it loses market value, which can lead to financial losses for the company. As a result, selecting the right management strategy can mean the difference between growth and decline.

Our focus will be to determine which market factors and data are essential for evaluating the strategy’s viability, and to identify the variables most likely to skew results in a negative direction.
## Stakeholder & User
The decider is the manager of the ETF, in our case, the project manager. The user is the buyer of the ETF or the customer on the secondary market.
## Useful Answer & Decision

The immediate answer to the question is almost always no. The market is ever changing, and thus we cannot assume that what worked last year is going to work again. The best way to decide on what measurments to use would be to access the data that we have at hand. Historical data will give us a glipse as to where the market has been heading but factoring in futures values,bond prices, as well as options could also give an indication of confidence in the overall market. Taking those four as the primary drivers and using aggregate information would give us a confident outlook on what this year's ETF could be. 
## Assumptions & Constraints
- We are limited to what is available to the open net, so many of the above values will be insuffucuent to make a fully confident decision off of.
- The constraint of about two weeks of class has  strong damper as well, we can only collect as much data as the time allows, thus being able to include everything will not be possible.
## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Many geopolitical risks cause market fluctuations, one in the current stage being tariffs to monitor this we could use the Vix to indicate overall market volatility to judge whether a more risk averse approach is suitable.
