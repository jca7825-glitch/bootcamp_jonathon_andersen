# Project Assumptions

## Summary

The understanding of the project is that we want to see what ETFs continuously out perfrom all others and/or the market. By taking the top ~5 or so ETFs we'll get a decent picture over the past decade about which ETFs are the most volitile and which are the most stable. Similarly we also want to see how correlated both factors are!


This matters to us because we naturally want our money to do the best for us, by comparing all of these ETFs we can assess what portion of the market is best to invest in.


## Context

The person who values this information the most is anyone who doesn't consider themselves savvy in the market. Many people don't know much about investing, so making an individual portfolio is like throwing multiple darts at a board and hoping some score well. We all want to have a strong retirement savings, so knowing what has had the best traditional outcome could help.
